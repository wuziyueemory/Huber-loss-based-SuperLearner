This folder includes the materials for conducting Monte Carlo Simulations to evaluate the proposed Huber loss-based super learner. The performance was assessed in two tasks that are common in biomedical cost research: cost prediction and estimation of average treatment effect (ATE). In both cases, we focus on the use case of our method where the Huber loss is used as a 'working loss function', as we anticipate these situations may arise more readily in practice.
