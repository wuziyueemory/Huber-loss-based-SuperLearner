# Huber-loss-based-SuperLearner
This repository is for manuscript "A Huber loss-based super learner with applications to healthcare expenditures".

The "Simulation" folder contains the code for conducting Monte Carlo simulations for cost prediction and causal effect estimation. The "BOLD data" folder contains the code and a sample input data set for BOLD analysis. The "MEPS data" folder contains the code and sample input data sets for MEPS analysis. `HuberSL` is the core function to fit the Huber loss-based super learner.
